# configuration of nfs server for sharing files between the machines:
# install nfs-utils using dnf install nfs-utils -y
# run systemctl start nfs-server.servive to start the nfs server
# run systemctl enable nfs-server.servive to enable the service at boot time.
# run systemctl status nfs-server.service to check the status of the nfs-server
# now run rpcinfo -p | grep nfs to check the nfs services.
# run mkdir -p /srv/nfs_share/docs to make a directory
# run chown -R nobody: /srv/nfs_share/docs to change the ownership of the directory and the sub-directories.
# run chmod -R 777 /srv/nfs_share/docs to change the permissions.
# run systemctl restart nfs-utils.service to restart the service.
# now open the exports file by running sudo nano /etc/exports and add /srv/nfs_share/docs localhost/24(rw,sync,no_all_squash,root_squash) to the file and then save it
  and exit.
# now run  exportfs -arv to check the file information(use the ip address of the client machine instead of using the localhost).
# to include more details, run exportfs -s
